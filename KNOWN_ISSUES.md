# Known Issues

## input-color

The component InputColor is a wrapper for the native HTML element `<input type="color">` which has accessibility problems:

- With NVDA, the element is announced as "clickable" and not as an input element.
- It's not possible to select a color using a screen reader.

For full accessibility, consider using predefined colors lists, e.g. using KolSelect or KolCheckbox.

[🐞 GitHub issue #5549](https://github.com/public-ui/kolibri/issues/5549)

## `aria-sort` changes sometimes not announced in NVDA

When a table column changes its sort order (i.e. when its `aria-sort` attribut changes), screen readers announce this change automatically.  
For unknown reasons, this sometime does not happen in NVDA.

[🐞 NVDA issue #10890](https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/10890)
[🐞 NVDA issue #8132](https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/8132)

## input-number and input-date 'readonly' not announced in NVDA

The components InputNumber and InputDate render their respective native HTML elements `<input type="number">` and `<input type="date">` which both support the
attribute `readonly`.  
When focusing the element, it's expected that the `readonly` attribute is announced as part of the element description. This isn't the case for NVDA.

## Toaster

Toasts are rendered in a container that's appended as first element of `<body>` and elevated using a high `z-index`.

When using [modal Dialogs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) these are rendered above toasts on the
[top layer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Top_layer). Hence, toast messages are always blocked by Modal Dialogs. We recommend completely
avoiding Toasts in Modals and giving feedback within the modal directly.

## input text

The `search` of this component is highly browser-dependent. For example, the close button is either shown or hidden depending on the browser. Accessibility is therefore not achieved.

## Screen reader only reads last selected in Select

KolSelect is using native HTML `<select>`. 

When using KolSelect with the `multiple` property, the native HTML `<select>` may cause problems with screen readers. 
Often the entire selection is not read out, but only the last one. Therefore, the KolSelect has no full accessibility.
